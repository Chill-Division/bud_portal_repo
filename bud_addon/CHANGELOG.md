# Changelog

## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-10
### Added
- **Ad-hoc Tasks**: Added support for "Once-off" tasks in Scheduling. These tasks appear in the "Due" list until completed once, then disappear (are not rescheduled).
- **Global History Viewer**: Added a new "View Task History" button on the Scheduling page. This opens a modal where you can view the last 5, 25, or 100 completed tasks across all schedules.
- **Auto-Migration (v0.12)**: System automatically updates the database schema to support the new 'Once-off' frequency option.



## [0.11.3] - 2026-01-10
### Fixed
- **UI Cleanup**: Completely removed obsolete "Supplier" and "Category" fields from the Add Stock and Edit Stock forms, ensuring a cleaner interface consistent with the table view.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive `README.md` to the addon root directory.



## [0.11.2] - 2026-01-10
### Fixed
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced audit logs to include specific context when items are deducted. Stock history will now explicitly state if an item was removed as part of a Bundle shipment via COC, or as a direct single-item COC transfer.
- **Documentation**: Updated project README to correctly reflect the SQLite architecture and remove obsolete MariaDB references.



## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-03
### Fixed
- **Dropdown Styling**: Fixed readability of category labels (`optgroup`) in dark mode by ensuring they have the correct background and contrast.



## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-03
### Added
- **COC Bundle Integration**: Product bundles can now be selected in Chain of Custody forms. Sending a bundle automatically deducts all its component items from stock.
- **Stock Action Enhancements**:
    - **Quick Adjustments**: New "Add" and "Remove" action buttons on the Stock page for rapid inventory updates.
    - **Validation**: System prevents removing more stock than available and enforces that Controlled Substances must only be removed via Chain of Custody forms.
    - **Audit History**: New "📜 History" button for each stock item showing a detailed log of all quantity changes, including notes and context (e.g., if it was part of a bundle shipment).
- **Filtered COC selection**: Chain of Custody item selection now only shows Controlled Substances by default to prevent accidental shipment of non-controlled items (like stickers) via COC forms.

### Changed
- **Stock UI Refinement**: Removed "Supplier" and "Category" columns from the main Stock Inventory table to improve readability and provide space for new action buttons.
- **Dashboard**: Replaced placeholder references with proper scheduling links.

### Technical
- Added `get_stock_history.php` endpoint for fetching audit logs.
- Updated `custody.php` backend to resolve bundle component IDs and handle automatic multi-item deductions.
- Enforced `is_controlled` validation flag across adjustment pathways.
